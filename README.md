This project focuses on a data-driven approach, by means of Logistic
and Linear Regression, to predict the credit risk capital of financial
institutions in providing loans to a person or an organisation. This
method trains an optimized regression on a data set and runs the
trained regression to calculate the total expected loss from a given
borrower. We calculate the total expected loss by combining our three
models-Probability of Default(PD),Loss Given Default(LGD),Exposure at
Default(EAD). Banks often calculate an EAD value for each loan and
then use these figures to determine their overall default risk. The
numerical results predicted by the model could help the financial
institution to maintain credit risk exposure within proper and
acceptable parameters. It is a process of mitigating losses by
understanding the adequacy of bankâ€™s capital and loan loss reserves in
past or at any given time.
